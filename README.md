# Link Repository Application
An application that can store bookmarks, share them on social media platforms and gather a brief description of the webpage by web crawling. Developed using Laravel web application framework for PHP and Bootstrap 3.2.0.

This application was developed during the Winter 2014 as an extracurricular project. Since then, the application has not been maintained and some functionalities (like social media sign-in and link crawling) might not work properly.
